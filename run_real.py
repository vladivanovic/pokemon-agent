"""Play the real game: boot a Pokemon Red ROM in PyBoy and let the agent
drive from the title screen through the opening.

    python3 run_real.py --rom /path/to/pokered.gbc [--workdir DIR]
                        [--player VLAD] [--rival GARY] [--starter squirtle]
                        [--max-rounds 12]

The ROM is not included in this repo. Building pret/pokered from source
(with RGBDS) produces a byte-identical retail Red ROM; any legally
obtained Red ROM with the same WRAM layout works.

What is deterministic here, and what is a scripted macro:

- Boot, Oak's intro speech and the two naming screens are a *macro*
  (_type_name below): a fresh boot is deterministic, so the speech is
  advanced by counted presses at a measured cadence (no RAM signal
  marks the naming screens - their tilemap shadow stays blank), names
  are typed on the letter grid, and the macro only hands over once a
  test step proves the player is free in the bedroom. Everything after
  the bedroom is the agent proper.
- The Oak intercept (walk north out of Pallet without a Pokemon and Oak
  walks you to the lab) and the starter pick are also macros, because
  they are cutscenes with their own rules: the lab's Poke Balls are inert
  flavor text until the intercept arms them, and the pick involves a
  full-screen PokeDex page that is not a standard text box. Both macros
  are short, use only the backend's verified primitives (walk_to,
  close_dialog, wait_free), and hand control back to the Executor.
- Everything else - leaving the lab, the rival battle, Route 1, the trip
  to Viridian Mart - is the Executor + ChecklistPlanner, unscripted.

Verified end-to-end on 2026-11-03 against a from-source pokered build
(SHA1 ea9bcae617fdf159b045185467ae58b2e4a48b9a): the agent took Squirtle,
won the rival battle, fought through Route 1 and reached Viridian Mart,
where the parcel scene played. Known open edge: the parcel *return* leg.
After the Mart's handover scene the player ends up in a spot where the
static interior model and the real game disagree (see README), so the
runner stops at the Mart for now instead of thrashing.

Speed: PyBoy headless runs this at roughly 2,000-2,500 fps, about
35-40x real-time; the whole opening takes a few seconds of wall clock.
